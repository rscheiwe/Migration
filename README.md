# Migration in the 21st-Century

Preliminary repository for culling data regarding migration statistics and unique coding algorithms to utilize cleaned and preprocessed data for interactive visualization(s) and predictive modelling.  

### Getting Started

Regardless the user's purposes, the final .pdf is useful for a practical overview of project aims, findings, and visualizations. The data is cross-validated with Data4Democracy participants, cleaned initially using Pythonic functions.

The following file is a library of functions for the purposes of cleaning and preprocessing:

```
migration.py
```

## Built With

* [Tableau](http://www.tableau.com) - Data visualization framework used
* [Viz for Social Good](http://www.vizforsocialgood.com) - Visualization community promoting social good projects
